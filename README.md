# machine-learning-threat-detection
End-to-end machine learning cybersecurity pipeline with threat intelligence enrichment, anomaly detection, and SIEM (Splunk) integration.

Machine Learning Threat Detection Pipeline
📦 **Repository Location: https://github.com/somtech4/machine-learning-threat-detection

This project links directly to my main Threat Hunting repository: https://github.com/somtech4/threat-hunting (Work in Progress)

This repository documents my ongoing project building an end-to-end Machine Learning Threat Detection Pipeline integrating:
Network attack classification (Malware, DDoS, Brute Force, SQL Injection)
Anomaly detection for zero-day behavior
Threat intelligence enrichment via AlienVault OTX
Data engineering + ML preprocessing for security telemetry
Export-ready outputs for SIEM ingestion (Splunk)
Although this project is still in development, I am actively committing updates as I progress.
